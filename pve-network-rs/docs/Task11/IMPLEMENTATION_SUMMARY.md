- **Key Features**:
  - Faucet OpenFlow controller management
  - YAML configuration generation
  - Switch and port configuration
  - VLAN management
  - ACL support (framework)
  - Systemd service integration

### 3. Plugin Factory System (`plugin_factory.rs`)

#### Dynamic Plugin Loading Framework
- **Purpose**: Provides extensible plugin system for SDN drivers
- **Key Features**:
  - Factory pattern for driver instantiation
  - Runtime driver registration/unregistration
  - Global factory instance management
  - Support for zone, controller, and IPAM plugins
  - Placeholder for future dynamic library loading
  - Thread-safe plugin management

#### Supported Plugin Types
- **Zone Drivers**: Simple, VLAN, QinQ, VXLAN, EVPN
- **Controller Drivers**: BGP, EVPN, Faucet
- **IPAM Drivers**: PVE, phpIPAM, NetBox

## Enhanced Core Types

### Updated Trait Definitions
- Added `Hash` and `Eq` traits to enum types for HashMap usage
- Added `Display` trait to `IpamType` for better error messages

- Added `ControllerConfig` and `ControllerStatus` structures

### Configuration Enhancements
- Extended `ZoneConfig` with advanced options support
- Added controller-specific configuration fields
- Improved validation methods across all configuration types

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Comprehensive Validation
- Syntax validation for all configuration parameters
- Semantic validation for network conflicts and dependencies
- Protocol-specific validation (RD/RT formats, IP addresses, etc.)
- Error handling with detailed context information

### 2. Configuration Generation
- Multiple output formats (interfaces, systemd, FRR, YAML)
- Template-based configuration generation
- Metadata generation for documentation
- Cross-platform compatibility considerations

### 3. System Integration
- Linux networking stack integration (ip, bridge commands)
- FRR routing daemon integration
- Systemd service management
- Process lifecycle management with PID tracking

### 4. Testing Framework
- Comprehensive unit tests for all components
